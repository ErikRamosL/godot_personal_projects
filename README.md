personal projects to put what i've learnt into practice

## Pong Game
Currently still a work in progress, but here is some things I might add in the future into the project:

* https://youtu.be/XSFkAzXQSWE
    * RigidBodies are wild, I need to learn how to use them.

    * Add a small squish effect when the ball bounces.

    * Make an effect where the camera lightly shifts towards the ball's position so the game wont feel as boring with a static camera.
